# Background

## Vulcan Schedule of Activities (SoA) Project

This IG is intended to provide a roadmap for adopters looking to use FHIR resources in order to support the planning and implementing Clinical Research designs.  The Schedule of Activities is defined ​in a clinical trial as a standardised representation of planned activities, including interventions (e.g., administering drug, surgery), studying administrative activities (e.g., obtaining informed consent, distributing clinical trial material and diaries, randomisation) and assessments.​

​The purpose of the Schedule of Activities is to communicate the scheduling of the planned activities required to support the research objectives of the study to enable operational implementation.​

Within the Vulcan SoA project we have considered two principal study types:
* Prospective – e.g., randomised clinical trials (RCT), concurrent cohort studies, observational studies, epidemiology, real world evidence (RWE) 
* Retrospective – e.g., cohort studies, case-control studies, real world evidence

Examples of positive outcomes for this project include:
* Participant identification – feasibility , inclusion/exclusion criteria (prospective/retrospective)​
* Participant management – appointment scheduling (prospective)​
* Real world evidence – research data selection (retrospective)​
* Audit/Inspection – regulatory oversight period identification ​
* Resource planning (prospective)​
* Logistics planning (prospective)​

This iteration for the project is designed to be directional purely - as we learn more about how the different systems work and can be interfaced. We will continue to improve the IG to accommodate more use cases, iteratively working towards a solution that will be both functional and scalable.
