## Background

## Vulcan Schedule of Activities (SoA) Project

### Schedule of Activities Definition:

​In a clinical trial, a standardised representation of planned activities, including interventions (e.g., administering drug, surgery), studying administrative activities (e.g., obtaining informed consent, distributing clinical trial material and diaries, randomisation) and assessments.​

A planned list of clinical trial activities to include interventions, assessments, and study administrative activities.

CDISC Definition:
A standardized representation of planned clinical trial activities including interventions (e.g., administering drug, surgery) and study administrative activities (e.g., obtaining informed consent, distributing clinical trial material and diaries, randomization) as well as assessments.

CDISC-GLOSS Definition:
A standardized representation of planned clinical trial activities including interventions (e.g., administering drug, surgery) and study administrative activities (e.g., obtaining informed consent, distributing clinical trial material and diaries, randomization) as well as assessments. See also schedule of assessments. Compare to study design schematic. 

​### Schedule of Activities Purpose: ​

​to communicate the scheduling of the planned activities required to support the research objectives of the study to enable operational implementation  ​

## Vulcan SoA Implementation Guide (IG)

This IG is intended to provide a roadmap for adopters looking to use FHIR resources in order to support the planning and implementing Clinical Research designs.  The Schedule of Activities is defined ​in a clinical trial as a standardised representation of planned activities, including interventions (e.g., administering drug, surgery), studying administrative activities (e.g., obtaining informed consent, distributing clinical trial material and diaries, randomisation) and assessments.​

​The purpose of the Schedule of Activities is to communicate the scheduling of the planned activities required to support the research objectives of the study to enable operational implementation.​

Within the Vulcan SoA project we have considered two principal study types:
* Prospective – e.g., randomised clinical trials (RCT), concurrent cohort studies, observational studies, epidemiology, real world evidence (RWE) 
* Retrospective – e.g., cohort studies, case-control studies, real world evidence

Examples of positive outcomes for this project include:
* Participant identification – feasibility , inclusion/exclusion criteria (prospective/retrospective)​
* Participant management – appointment scheduling (prospective)​
* Real world evidence – research data selection (retrospective)​
* Audit/Inspection – regulatory oversight period identification ​
* Resource planning (prospective)​
* Logistics planning (prospective)​

This iteration for the project is designed to be directional purely - as we learn more about how the different systems work and can be interfaced. We will continue to improve the IG to accommodate more use cases, iteratively working towards a solution that will be both functional and scalable.
