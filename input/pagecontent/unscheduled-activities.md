# Unscheduled Activities

​Unscheduled assessments may be included in the SoA in order to account for special events that may arise; they may include:​
* Repeated Activities (e.g. additional blood draws)​
* Triggered Activities (e.g. extra tests based on some lab result)​
* Repeated Encounters (e.g. cycles for oncology)​
* Triggered Encounters (e.g. Adverse Event post visit)​

The Implementation Guide needs to provide a path for:​
* The definition of unscheduled or repeatable activities​
* The definition of an event for augmentation of the executable artifact (e.g. CarePlan) to accommodate unscheduled or repeatable activities​
* Adding an extra activity to an encounter​

## Use Cases

### Use Case - Conditional Activities
Protocols routinely describe assessments that are only to be undertaken under certain circumstances (e.g. pregnancy test)​
Additional assessments may be included in the SoA in order to account for special events that may arise; they may include:​
* A need to repeated an Activity (e.g. additional blood draws)​
* Event/Observation Triggered Activities (e.g. extra tests based on some lab result)​

​
### Use Case - Unscheduled Visits
Details of a study participant's "visits" (encounters) that are not planned (i.e. study scheduled) need to be recorded and appropriate study defined assessments undertaken to ensure subject safety, and sponsor regulatory and study objectives are not compromised (required activities usually defined by a SoA ‘Unscheduled Visit’ option) ​

May arise due to identified issues/events (e.g. AE see earlier) or required clinical care not recognised by the protocol.​

### Use Case - Early Termination​
According to criteria specified in the Protocol a participant may be taken off the study; reasons can include:​
* Safety Concerns – Subject had a reaction to intervention​
* Death – Patient died while on Study (related or non-related to intervention)​
* Study close – Intervention was either too successful or not successful enough then the sponsor can close out the study​
* Protocol Amendment – closing out participants on a chosen arm based on therapeutic outcome​

This represents a branch in the normal participant path through the study​

### Use Case - Protocol Amendments
A protocol amendment will often change the subject path but adding or removing encounters or assessments ​
The CarePlan for a patient will need to be adapted to incorporate the changes in the study
